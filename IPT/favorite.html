    Google is one of the most famous search engines worldwide. It is now very crucial to have this type of search engine where we, people,
    are able to find whatever we want virtually or online. Without Google, some of our fellow students who are not indeed into actual references
    or resources would have a difficult time to search specific topics. Google has multiple information that is easily accessible to many kind of 
    individuals. Also, if we are curious about anything like the BIG BANG THEORY, we can simply just type it on the search bar and tada! That's it.

        Hmmm what I chose Tumblr? Familiar with Tumblr? Oh Nah? Well, this is one of my most favorite website. Why? For the reason that 
        I can post my thoughts and works here anytime real quick without any incovenience. I'm into blogging and yeah TUMBLR is a blogging website.
        I am able to post poems there and some of my stuff too. If you want to learn and know everything or just keep updated regards to what
        is actually happening around us, this is one of the website that you should use.

        Reddit is a free place, free online platform where you can join to any type of community. Joining communities makes your socialization better.
        And of course, you can discuss your interest there. It allows users to socialize about some certain topics like in Music, Movies, News Update,
        contemporary issues, etc. What I really like in Reddit is that people there are all strangers, they don't definitely know what someone looks like
        or what really is her/his name. Everyone personally don't know each other. Just decent strangers sharing thoughts and ideas online.

        Instagram is where we can socialize to our family, relatives, and friends. We are able to post, edit, and capture photos and videos.
        It is really fun to use because it has so many interesting and creative features that we can use. And there's this one feature that we upload 
        stories to share to our followers or friends. This is one of the websites or application to keep in touch with our people long distance.

        Grammarly for me is a useful virtual assistant for me when it comes to fixing grammars. I do admit that I'm not really that good at
        analyzing grammars when I'm doing paperworks so that's why Grammarly is very helpful and essential for me. Grammarly can see the complications
        in our paragraph like the spelling, wordiness, the sentence punctuation, and the plagiarism as well. We can avoid plagiarism (even we can say that
        it's our own work, expect that in our work, it can be labeled as plagiarized because of the construction of the sentences). Grammarly is as same
        as Quillbot.
